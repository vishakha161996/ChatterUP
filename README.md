# ChatterUp - Real-Time Chat Application

ChatterUp is an interactive real-time chat application designed to facilitate seamless communication and interaction between users. Built using Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, and MongoDB, it offers a robust and engaging chat experience.

## Features

### Socket-Based Architecture

ChatterUp utilizes WebSockets via the Socket.io library, enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between users.

### Code Modularity

The project follows modern development practices by employing ES6 Modules for code organization, ensuring maintainability and collaboration.

### User-Friendly Chat UI

The chat user interface is thoughtfully designed to enhance the user experience. It features components for seamless chatting and a notification panel displaying online users.

### User Onboarding

New users are prompted to provide their name upon joining ChatterUp for the first time. A warm welcome message is displayed in the header with their name.

### Chat History and User Count

Newly joined users have access to chat history and receive real-time information about the number of users currently online.

### Broadcasting Messages and Database Storage

Messages sent by users are broadcasted to all connected users in real-time and securely stored in the database for future reference.

### User Typing Indicators

A 'typing...' indicator is displayed to all connected users as users type messages, indicating which user is currently typing.

### Notification of New User Joins

When a new user joins, their name is added to the notification panel with an online symbol (green dot), and all connected users are notified.

### Notification of User Disconnections

When a user leaves the application, the notification panel is updated to reflect the remaining connected users.

### Profile Pictures for User Consistency

Each user has an associated profile picture displayed throughout the conversation, ensuring consistent visual identity.

### Displaying Chat Messages

Chat messages display the user's name, profile picture, message content, and timestamp for a comprehensive chat experience.
